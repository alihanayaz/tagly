# Introduction

**Tagly** is a bookmark management tool designed to help users organize, categorize, and access their bookmarks efficiently. With features like collections, favorites, and pagination, Tagly ensures a seamless experience for managing online resources.

This project was created as the **capstone project for CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript**. It represents a culmination of the skills developed during the course, including implementing Django models, JavaScript interactivity, mobile responsiveness, and scalable database solutions.

## Installation

<details>
<summary>Step-by-step instructions</summary>

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alihanayaz/tagly.git
cd tagly
```

### 2. Set up a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure the `.env` file

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

```env
SECRET_KEY='your-secret-key'
DEBUG=True  # Change to False in production
ALLOWED_HOSTS='127.0.0.1,0.0.0.0,localhost,.your-deployment-domain'
DB_NAME=your_database_name
DB_USER=your_database_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
DB_HOST=your_database_host
DB_PORT=your_database_port
```

### 5. Set up the PostgreSQL database

Ensure the database credentials in your `.env` file are correct, then run:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### 6. Create a superuser

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 7. Run the development server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### 8. Prepare for production (if `DEBUG=False`)

Run the following to collect static files:

```bash
python manage.py collectstatic
```

## How to Run the Application

Once the setup is complete, follow these steps:

1. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
2. Create a new account or log in with the superuser credentials.
3. Use the interface to manage your bookmarks by adding, editing, deleting, and organizing them into collections.

## How Tagly Works

1. **User Authentication**:

   - Secure login and signup using Django's authentication system.
   - Custom user model to support both email and username for login.

2. **Bookmark Management**:

   - Create, edit, and delete bookmarks.
   - Organize bookmarks into user-defined collections.
   - Mark bookmarks as favorites for easy access.

3. **Responsive Design**:

   - Fully mobile-responsive layout for seamless use on all devices.

4. **Pagination**:
   - Paginate bookmarks and collections for improved usability and performance.

## Distinctiveness and Complexity

Tagly stands apart from other CS50W projects due to its unique feature set, advanced implementation, and focus on user-centric functionality. Below is an expanded explanation of how it meets the distinctiveness and complexity requirements:

### Distinctiveness

1. **Unique Application Domain**:

   - Tagly is a **bookmark management tool**, a domain not covered by any of the existing projects in CS50W. It provides functionalities beyond basic CRUD operations by introducing advanced features like favorites, collections, and categorization.
   - The concept of organizing bookmarks into collections, marking favorites, and accessing bookmarks efficiently is distinct and serves a practical real-world purpose.

2. **Interactive Front-End**:

   - Unlike other projects in the course, Tagly extensively uses **AJAX for real-time interactions**. All major actions (such as adding, editing, deleting, and toggling favorites) are processed asynchronously, making the app more responsive and user-friendly.

3. **Custom Authentication Backend**:

   - The authentication system allows users to log in using either their username or email address, demonstrating a deeper understanding of Django's extensibility.

4. **Professional Features**:
   - Features like server-side pagination, responsive design, and production-ready static file management (via `whitenoise`) make Tagly feel like a polished, real-world application.

### Complexity

1. **Advanced Back-End Logic**:

   - The **Django models** for `Bookmark` and `Collection` include advanced relationships, constraints, and custom fields. For example, bookmarks are tied to users and can optionally belong to collections. This introduces relational database management and foreign key handling.
   - The back-end includes **complex view logic** to support filtering, sorting, and paginating bookmarks dynamically.

2. **AJAX and JavaScript Integration**:

   - JavaScript is extensively used to provide a smooth user experience. Key functionalities include:
     - Dynamic loading of bookmarks without reloading the page.
     - Pagination controls that update content asynchronously.
     - Interactive modals for editing bookmarks and collections.

3. **Database Management with PostgreSQL**:

   - PostgreSQL was chosen for its robustness and scalability, demonstrating the ability to work with production-grade databases. The app uses a relational schema that ensures data integrity and efficient querying.

4. **Responsive Design**:

   - The application is fully mobile-responsive, ensuring compatibility across different devices. This required thoughtful CSS design and testing on multiple screen sizes.

5. **Production-Ready Static File Handling**:

   - The use of `whitenoise` for static file management demonstrates understanding of deployment requirements and Django's production capabilities.

6. **Error Handling and Edge Cases**:

   - Edge cases such as invalid form submissions, attempts to access unauthorized resources, and handling empty states (e.g., "No bookmarks found") are thoughtfully managed.

7. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - The front-end and back-end responsibilities are clearly delineated, with API endpoints serving as the bridge. The project structure adheres to the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern, ensuring maintainability and scalability.
